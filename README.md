# Vision Transformer and MLP-Mixer Architectures for Vision

**Update (18.6.2021)**: This repository was rewritten to use Flax Linen API and
`ml_collections.ConfigDict` for configuration.

In this repository we release models from the papers
[An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)
and
[MLP-Mixer: An all-MLP Architecture for Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01601)
that were pre-trained on the [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) (imagenet)
and [ImageNet-21k](http://www.image-net.org/) (imagenet21k) datasets. We
provide the code for fine-tuning the released models in
[Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io)/[Flax](http://flax.readthedocs.io).

## Colab

We prepared a Colab that walks you through loading data from `tfds`, evaluating
a model, downloading pre-trained weights, fine-tuning, and inference on
individual images.

The Colab works demonstrates the use of both Vision Transformers and MLP Mixers,
and works with GPU and TPU (8 cores, data parallelism) runtimes:

https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/vision_transformer/blob/master/vit_jax.ipynb

Note that the Colab can be run as is storing all data in the ephemeral VM, or,
alternatively you can log into your personal Google Drive to persist the code
and data there.


## Installation

Make sure you have `Python>=3.6` installed on your machine.

For installing [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax), follow the instructions
provided in the corresponding repository linked here. Note that installation
instructions for GPU differs slightly from the instructions for CPU.

Then, install python dependencies by running:
```
pip install -r vit_jax/requirements.txt
```

For more details refer to the section [Running on Google Cloud] below.


## Fine-tuning a model

You can run fine-tuning of the downloaded model on your dataset of interest. All
models share the same command line interface.

For example for fine-tuning a ViT-B/16 (pre-trained on imagenet21k) on CIFAR10
(note how we specify `b16,cifar10` as arguments to the config, and how we
instruct the code to access the models directly from a GCS bucket instead of
first downloading them into the local directory):

```bash
python -m vit_jax.main --workdir=/tmp/vit \
    --config=$(pwd)/vit_jax/configs/vit.py:b16,cifar10 \
    --config.pretrained_dir='gs://vit_models/imagenet21k'
```

In order to fine-tune a Mixer-B/16 (pre-trained on imagenet21k) on CIFAR10:

```bash
python -m vit_jax.main --workdir=/tmp/mixer \
    --config=$(pwd)/vit_jax/configs/mixer_base16_cifar10.py \
    --config.pretrained_dir='gs://mixer_models/imagenet21k'
```

Currently, the code will automatically download CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.
Other public or custom datasets can be easily integrated, using [tensorflow
datasets library](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/). Note that you will
also need to update `vit_jax/input_pipeline.py` to specify some parameters about
any added dataset.

Note that our code uses all available GPUs/TPUs for fine-tuning.

To see a detailed list of all available flags, run `python3 -m vit_jax.train
--help`.

Notes about some flags:

-   `--config.accum_steps=16` : This works well with ViT-B_16 on a machine that
    has 8 GPUs of type V100 with 16G memory each attached. If you have fewer
    accelerators or accelerators with less memory, you can use the same
    configuration but increase the `--config.accum_steps`. For a small model
    like ViT-B_32 you can even use `--config.accum_steps=1`. For a large model
    like ViT-L_16 you need to go in the other direction (e.g.
    `--config.accum_steps=32`). Note that the largest model ViT-H_14 also needs
    adaptation of the batch size (`--config.accum_steps=2 --config.batch=16`
    should work on a 8x V100). tested `)
-   `--config.batch=512` : Alternatively, you can decrease the batch size, but
    that usually involves some tuning of the learning rate parameters.


## Vision Transformer

Weissenborn\*, Xiaohua Zhai\*, Thomas Unterthiner, Mostafa Dehghani, Matthias
Minderer, Georg Heigold, Sylvain Gelly, Jakob Uszkoreit and Neil Houlsby\*†.

(\*) equal technical contribution, (†) equal advising.

![Figure 1 from paper](vit_figure.png)

Overview of the model: we split an image into fixed-size patches, linearly embed
each of them, add position embeddings, and feed the resulting sequence of
vectors to a standard Transformer encoder. In order to perform classification,
we use the standard approach of adding an extra learnable "classification token"
to the sequence.

### Available ViT models

We provide models pre-trained on imagenet21k for the following architectures:
ViT-B/16, ViT-B/32, ViT-L/16 and ViT-L/32. We  provide the same models
pre-trained on imagenet21k *and* fine-tuned on imagenet2012.

**Update (1.12.2020)**: We have added the R50+ViT-B/16 hybrid model (ViT-B/16 on
top of a Resnet-50 backbone). When pretrained on imagenet21k, this model
achieves almost the performance of the L/16 model with less than half the
computational finetuning cost. Note that "R50" is somewhat modified for the B/16
variant: The original ResNet-50 has [3,4,6,3] blocks, each reducing the
resolution of the image by a factor of two. In combination with the ResNet stem
this would result in a reduction of 32x so even with a patch size of (1,1) the
ViT-B/16 variant cannot be realized anymore. For this reason we instead use
[3,4,9] blocks for the R50+B/16 variant.

**Update (9.11.2020)**: We have also added the ViT-L/16 model.

**Update (29.10.2020)**: We have added ViT-B/16 and ViT-L/16 models pretrained
on ImageNet-21k and then fine-tuned on ImageNet at 224x224 resolution (instead
of default 384x384). These models have the suffix "-224" in their name.
They are expected to achieve 81.2% and 82.7% top-1 accuracies respectively.

You can find all these models in the following storage bucket:

https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/vit_models/

For example, if you would like to download the ViT-B/16 pre-trained on
imagenet21k run the following command:

```
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/vit_models/imagenet21k/ViT-B_16.npz
```

### Expected ViT results

Table below runs experiments both with `transformer.dropout_rate=0.1` (as in the
ViT paper), and with `transformer.dropout_rate=0.0`, which improves results
somewhat for models B=16, B/32, and L/32. The better setting was chosen for the
default config of the models in this repository.

We also would like to emphasize that high-quality results can be achieved with
shorter training schedules and encourage users of our code to play with
hyper-parameters to trade-off accuracy and computational budget.
Some examples for CIFAR-10/100 datasets are presented in the table below.

(\*) equal contribution.

![Figure 1 from paper](mixer_figure.png)

MLP-Mixer (*Mixer* for short) consists of per-patch linear embeddings, Mixer
layers, and a classifier head. Mixer layers contain one token-mixing MLP and one
channel-mixing MLP, each consisting of two fully-connected layers and a GELU
nonlinearity. Other components include: skip-connections, dropout, and linear
classifier head.

For installation follow [the same steps](#installation) as above.

### Available Mixer models

We provide the Mixer-B/16 and Mixer-L/16 models pre-trained on the ImageNet and
ImageNet-21k datasets. Details can be found in Table 3 of the Mixer paper. All
the models can be found at:

https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/mixer_models/

### Expected Mixer results

We ran the fine-tuning code on Google Cloud machine with four V100 GPUs with the
default adaption parameters from this repository. Here are the results:

## Running on cloud

You can use the following commands to setup a VM with GPUs on Google Cloud:

```bash
# Set variables used by all commands below.
# Note that project must have accounting set up.
# For a list of zones with GPUs refer to
# https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/gpu-regions-zones
PROJECT=my-awesome-gcp-project
VM_NAME=vit-jax-vm
ZONE=europe-west4-b

# Below settings have been tested with this repository. You can choose other
# combinations of images & machines, refer to the corresponding gcloud commands:
# gcloud compute images list --project ml-images
# gcloud compute machine-types list
# etc.
gcloud compute instances create $VM_NAME \
    --project=$PROJECT --zone=$ZONE \
    --image=c1-deeplearning-tf-2-5-cu110-v20210527-debian-10 \
    --image-project=ml-images --machine-type=n1-standard-96 \
    --scopes=cloud-platform,storage-full --boot-disk-size=256GB \
    --boot-disk-type=pd-ssd --metadata=install-nvidia-driver=True \
    --maintenance-policy=TERMINATE \
    --accelerator=type=nvidia-tesla-v100,count=8

# Connect to VM.
gcloud compute ssh --project $PROJECT --zone $ZONE $VM_NAME

# Delete VM after use.
gcloud compute instances delete --project $PROJECT --zone $ZONE $VM_NAME
```

And then fetch the repository and the install dependencies (including `jaxlib`
with TPU support) as usual:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer
cd vision_transformer
pip3 install virtualenv
python3 -m virtualenv env
. env/bin/activate
pip3 install --upgrade jax jaxlib \
    -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_releases.html
pip install -r vit_jax/requirements.txt
python
```

And finally execute the command as mentioned in [How to fine-tune ViT].
